Rated at the Peak? Firm Valuation around the First LSEG ESG Score in Five Southeast Asian Markets

@@ running_title
Valuation around first ESG scores

@@ abstract
Using the staggered first appearance of London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores for {{n_treated_all}} non-financial firms in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, and {{n_never}} never-scored firms, we estimate heterogeneity-robust difference-in-differences effects on market-to-book ratios. Scored firms grew faster than comparable firms before their first scored year. Afterwards, market-to-book ratios did not rise: the estimate is {{mtb_att}} (95% interval {{mtb_lo}} to {{mtb_hi}}) under parallel trends and {{mtb_R10}} when coverage is dated one year later. The first score arrives near a valuation peak, not before a gain.

# 1. Introduction

Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores now enter portfolio screens, index rules, and the mandates of sustainable funds. For a listed firm, the question of whether it is scored at all can matter as much as the level of its score. A firm without a score cannot enter a portfolio that holds only rated stocks, and a first score can, in principle, widen the set of investors who follow the stock. Merton (1987) shows that a larger investor base lowers the required return and raises the price of a stock. Models of sustainable investing add a preference channel: investors who value ESG attributes accept lower expected returns on assets they can classify as sustainable (Pástor, Stambaugh, and Taylor, 2021; Pedersen, Fitzgibbons, and Pomorski, 2021). Evidence from mutual funds shows that investors respond strongly to newly published sustainability ratings (Hartzmark and Sussman, 2019). Together, these arguments predict that the initiation of ESG rating coverage raises a firm's market valuation.

A second prediction runs in the opposite direction of causality. Rating providers decide which firms to score, and a firm usually enters a provider's universe after it has become large, liquid, or visible enough to matter to the provider's clients, for example because it has joined an index. Coverage decisions of this kind resemble index additions. Additions to a major index raise prices around the announcement (Shleifer, 1986; Harris and Gurel, 1986), part of the effect reverses within weeks (Harris and Gurel, 1986), and a permanent component has been attributed to greater investor awareness (Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004). If coverage responds to past growth in market value, scored firms will look more valuable than unscored firms even when the score itself changes nothing. A static comparison of rated and unrated firms, or a regression that pools all years before and after coverage, then attributes past growth to the rating.

Evidence on the consequences of rating coverage comes mainly from U.S. firms. Tsang, Wang, Xiang, and Yu (2024) find that firms covered by more ESG rating agencies commit fewer ESG violations, and the same authors document dividend changes after the initiation of coverage by non-financial rating agencies (Tsang, Wang, Xiang, and Yu, 2025). Bikmetova and Pirinsky (2026) study the intensity of coverage among U.S. firms and find that additional coverage is followed by lower toxic emissions, better ratings, and higher ownership by institutions that prefer high-ESG stocks. Research on sell-side analysts offers a closer analogue for valuation: the loss of analyst coverage lowers prices (Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2012), and the first analyst report on a neglected stock earns a positive announcement return that is driven by favorable coverage rather than by coverage as such (Demiroglu and Ryngaert, 2010). What we do not know is whether the first appearance of a firm-level ESG score moves the valuation of firms in emerging equity markets, where most listed firms are unscored and where coverage has expanded in large waves.

We study this question in five Southeast Asian markets: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand. The London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG), whose ESG scores were previously distributed as Refinitiv ESG and earlier as ASSET4 scores, extended coverage in these markets in waves that differ by market: {{n_coh_2020_2023}} of the {{n_treated_all}} non-financial firms that entered coverage between {{n_coh_min_year}} and {{n_coh_max_year}} did so in 2020 to 2023. Most listed firms remained unscored, which provides a large pool of comparison firms from the same exchanges and years. We treat the first fiscal year with an LSEG ESG score as a staggered event and estimate group-time average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) with the estimator of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021), which avoids the biases of two-way fixed effects regressions when treatment timing varies and effects differ across cohorts (Goodman-Bacon, 2021; Baker, Larcker, and Wang, 2022). The primary outcome is the natural logarithm of the market-to-book (MTB) ratio. We recorded the hypotheses, sample rules, estimator, and robustness checks in a pre-analysis plan before estimating any effect, and we label every analysis added afterwards as exploratory.

The evidence has three parts. First, scored firms grew faster than comparable never-scored firms in the years before their first scored year. Relative to that base year, their market capitalization was {{mcap_em5}} log points lower five years earlier, and their MTB ratio was {{mtb_em5}} log points lower. Second, MTB ratios did not rise after coverage began. Under conditional parallel trends from the base year, the average effect over the first four years is {{mtb_att}} (standard error {{mtb_se}}), with a 95% confidence interval from {{mtb_lo}} to {{mtb_hi}}. Third, when we date coverage one year later, which allows for the time it takes to publish a score built from a firm's annual disclosures, the effect becomes {{mtb_R10}} (*p* {{mtb_R10_p_txt}}). Valuations therefore peak around the first scored year and do not gain afterwards. A static two-way fixed effects regression on the same data attributes a {{mtb_R6_pct}} percent MTB increase to coverage, which illustrates how a pooled design turns selection into an apparent rating effect.

We do not claim that coverage has no effect on valuation. The pre-coverage run-up casts doubt on the parallel-trends assumption that the post-coverage estimates need. When we allow post-coverage departures from parallel trends of up to a quarter of the largest year-to-year change observed before coverage, in the spirit of Rambachan and Roth (2023), the interval for the MTB effect widens to {{mtb_rm025_lo}} to {{mtb_rm025_hi}}. What the data support is an ordering of events: the first score follows a period of relative growth and coincides with a valuation peak, and no specification shows a valuation gain after it.

The paper contributes to research on the financial consequences of ESG ratings. Ratings from different providers disagree widely (Berg, Kölbel, and Rigobon, 2022), disagreement rises with disclosure (Christensen, Serafeim, and Sikochi, 2022), and it carries a return premium and affects demand (Gibson Brandon, Krueger, and Schmidt, 2021; Avramov, Cheng, Lioui, and Tarelli, 2022). The historical scores of the provider we study have been rewritten on a large scale (Berg, Fabisik, and Sautner, 2020), and its recent scores remain subject to revision (Sahin, Bax, Paterlini, and Czado, 2023). We add evidence from emerging markets on the extensive margin of coverage, measured against a large group of never-scored firms, and we show that the selection of firms into coverage is itself a first-order fact for anyone who compares rated and unrated firms. The results also illustrate how pre-trends in staggered designs can carry economic content (Roth, 2022).

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews related work and states the hypotheses. Section 3 describes the institutional setting and the data. Section 4 presents the empirical design. Section 5 reports the results. Section 6 discusses them, Section 7 states the limitations, and Section 8 concludes.

# 2. Related Literature and Hypotheses

## 2.1. Ratings, investor demand, and valuation

Two mechanisms link the first ESG score to a firm's valuation. The first is investor recognition. In Merton (1987), investors hold only the stocks they know about, and a stock followed by fewer investors trades at a lower price because its idiosyncratic risk is borne by a small group. A first score makes the firm visible to investors who screen on ESG data. The second mechanism is preference: when some investors derive utility from holding sustainable assets, the prices of assets classified as sustainable rise and their expected returns fall (Pástor, Stambaugh, and Taylor, 2021; Pedersen, Fitzgibbons, and Pomorski, 2021). Both channels predict a positive effect of coverage on valuation, and the second predicts a larger effect for firms that receive a high initial score.

The strength of either channel depends on whether investors act on the particular score. Fund investors react to fund-level sustainability ratings (Hartzmark and Sussman, 2019), and the holdings of ESG funds in the United States respond to the ratings of one provider more than to those of others (Berg, Heeb, and Kölbel, 2022). Scores from different providers disagree (Berg, Kölbel, and Rigobon, 2022), and disagreement is priced (Gibson Brandon, Krueger, and Schmidt, 2021; Avramov, Cheng, Lioui, and Tarelli, 2022). A score from one provider may therefore be a weak signal for investors who follow another provider, which would weaken both mechanisms.

## 2.2. Coverage as a selection event

Rating coverage is not assigned at random. Providers extend coverage to firms that belong to the indices their clients track and that disclose enough information to be scored. Mandatory sustainability reporting raises the amount of information available about listed firms (Krueger, Sautner, Tang, and Zhong, 2024), which can make scoring feasible. The size of a firm also affects the score it receives: larger firms receive higher scores from the provider we study (Dobrick, Klein, and Zwergel, 2023). If providers select firms that have grown, a comparison of the valuations of scored and unscored firms mixes the effect of coverage with the growth that led to it.

The setting matters for the size of these effects. In markets where public information about listed firms is scarce, an additional source of standardized information should matter more for prices and liquidity. Krueger, Sautner, Tang, and Zhong (2024) find that mandatory ESG disclosure raises stock liquidity, and that the effect is strongest for firms with weaker information environments. By the same logic, a first ESG score could matter more in emerging markets than in the United States. The opposite is also possible: if providers score only firms that are already large and closely followed, the firms that receive a first score are the ones for which the score adds least. Which force dominates is an empirical question that the comparison of scored and never-scored firms in the same markets can address.

The analogy with sell-side coverage is instructive. Losing analyst coverage raises information asymmetry and lowers prices (Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2012), while the first coverage of a neglected stock raises its price only when the coverage is favorable (Demiroglu and Ryngaert, 2010). An ESG score differs from an analyst report because it rarely contains news about cash flows, and because it arrives with a delay after the firm's own disclosures. The analogy suggests that any valuation effect of a first ESG score should be concentrated in firms that receive favorable scores and in firms that were less visible before coverage.

## 2.3. Hypotheses

The pre-analysis plan states three hypotheses, tested two-sided.

H1 (primary): The initiation of LSEG ESG coverage changes the log MTB ratio of scored firms relative to comparable never-scored firms. The recognition and preference channels predict a positive effect (Merton, 1987; Pástor, Stambaugh, and Taylor, 2021; Pedersen, Fitzgibbons, and Pomorski, 2021). The selection view predicts no effect after coverage, together with relative growth before coverage, as for firms that are added to an index after a period of growth (Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004).

H2 (secondary): Coverage changes log market capitalization, book leverage, and log total assets.

H3 (heterogeneity): The effect on log MTB differs between firms that receive an initial score above and below the median of their cohort, as the preference channel (Pedersen, Fitzgibbons, and Pomorski, 2021) and the evidence on favorable first coverage (Demiroglu and Ryngaert, 2010) suggest.

# 3. Institutional Setting and Data

## 3.1. ESG rating coverage in the five markets

The five markets differ in size, development, and disclosure rules. Singapore is the most developed of the five, and its exchange requires every listed issuer to publish an annual sustainability report on a comply-or-explain basis for financial years ending on or after 31 December 2017 (Singapore Exchange, 2016). The report must be issued with the annual report, or within five months of the financial year-end when the issuer obtains external assurance. In Malaysia, ESG scores of FTSE Russell, another part of LSEG, covered the constituents of the FTSE Bursa Malaysia EMAS index, about 30 percent of listed companies, until Bursa Malaysia and LSEG agreed in November 2022 to extend these scores to all companies on the Main and ACE Markets (Bernama, 2022). This paper studies the LSEG ESG score, formerly Refinitiv ESG, which is a different product from the FTSE Russell scores. Some firms that enter LSEG coverage may therefore already have been scored by FTSE Russell or by other providers; our data do not record those scores.

Coverage entered the five markets in waves (Table IA2 and Figure IA1 of the Internet Appendix). Thailand and Singapore account for {{n_th_sg_2019_2020}} first scores in 2019 and 2020, and Malaysia for {{n_my_2021_2022}} first scores in 2021 and 2022. Over the full period, Malaysian firms account for {{n_my_treated}} of the {{n_treated_all}} scored firms ({{pct_my_treated}} percent), and Malaysian and Thai firms together for {{pct_my_th_treated}} percent; Indonesia contributes {{n_id_treated}}, Singapore {{n_sg_treated}}, and the Philippines {{n_ph_treated}} scored firms. The pooled estimates are therefore weighted toward Malaysia and Thailand, and we report market-level estimates in the Internet Appendix. The data do not record why the provider expanded coverage in a given market and year; changes in disclosure rules (Singapore Exchange, 2016), which raise the information available about listed firms (Krueger, Sautner, Tang, and Zhong, 2024), and changes in index membership are possible reasons that we cannot observe.

## 3.2. Sample and coverage timing

The data set covers all {{n_universe_firms}} firms listed in the five markets from 2014 to 2024 ({{n_universe_fy}} firm-years). It combines the annual LSEG ESG score (LSEG, 2025) with accounting and market data from Compustat Global (S&P Global Market Intelligence, 2025). We use the ESG score field, not the combined score that adjusts for controversies. [[COMPANION]] That study uses only firm-years with ESG and governance data and asks how reporting standards and board structure relate to the gap between ESG scores and controversy scores. The present paper uses the full listed universe, treats the first appearance of an ESG score as an event, and studies market valuation and financing. No outcome or treatment variable, estimate, table, or figure is shared between the two papers.

We drop financial firms, which leaves {{n_nonfin_firms}} firms. A firm's treatment year is the first fiscal year with a non-missing LSEG ESG score. Once a firm is scored, it almost always remains scored ({{n_cov_gap}} of the {{n_treated_all}} scored firms have a later year without a score), so we treat coverage as permanent, which is the staggered-adoption setting of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021). We drop the {{n_cov2014}} firms that were already scored in 2014 because they have no pre-coverage year. The estimation sample has {{n_est_firms}} firms and {{n_est_fy}} firm-years: {{n_treated_all}} firms first scored between {{n_coh_min_year}} and {{n_coh_max_year}} and {{n_never}} firms never scored. Table IA4 of the Internet Appendix reports the number of firm-years available for each outcome. Never-scored firms are, on average, much smaller than scored firms, and many of them are small firms with thin trading. They remain in the sample for all years in which their outcomes are observed and serve as the pool from which each cohort's counterfactual change is estimated. Because the comparison rests on changes adjusted for size, country, and industry, it does not require the two groups to have similar levels, but it does require enough never-scored firms of comparable size. The robustness check that drops never-scored firms below the size range of scored firms (Section 4.5) addresses this requirement.

The treatment year is the first fiscal year for which the downloaded data contain a score, which need not be the year in which investors could first see a score. Two features of the data create a gap. First, the score for fiscal year *g* is built from the firm's reports for that year, which are published after the year ends; a score dated *g* reaches investors in year *g* + 1 at the earliest. Second, the provider has rewritten historical scores on a large scale (Berg, Fabisik, and Sautner, 2020), and scores for the five most recent fiscal years can change after publication (Sahin et al., 2023). If historical years were filled in when a firm entered coverage, the treatment year precedes the first published score by more than one year. Both features move the true publication date later than our treatment year, never earlier. They cannot place a recorded score in a year before the treatment year, so they do not create the pre-coverage growth we report, but they can place pre-publication years in our post-coverage window. We address this with estimates that date coverage one year later (Section 5.4).

## 3.3. Outcomes

The primary outcome is the natural logarithm of the MTB ratio, the market value of equity divided by its book value. Three secondary outcomes describe size and financing: the logarithm of market capitalization, book leverage (total debt divided by total assets), and the logarithm of total assets. Market capitalization reflects both price changes and changes in the number of shares, and the data contain neither stock returns nor shares outstanding, so we use MTB for statements about valuation and market capitalization for statements about size. Monetary amounts are in U.S. dollars as recorded in the data set. We winsorize MTB, market capitalization, leverage, and total assets at the 1st and 99th percentiles of the pooled sample before taking logarithms.

# 4. Empirical Design

## 4.1. Target parameter and identification

We follow the notation of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021). Let *G*~i~ denote the first year in which firm *i* has an LSEG ESG score, with *G*~i~ = ∞ for firms never scored, and let *Y*~i,t~(*g*) denote the potential outcome of firm *i* in year *t* if it were first scored in year *g*. The group-time average treatment effect on the treated is

$$latex \mathrm{ATT}(g,t)=\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i,t}(g)-Y_{i,t}(\infty)\mid G_i=g\right] | (1)

the average effect in year *t* of first coverage in year *g* among firms first scored in year *g* (Callaway and Sant'Anna, 2021). We identify it under conditional parallel trends relative to the year before coverage:

$$latex \mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i,t}(\infty)-Y_{i,g-1}(\infty)\mid X_i,G_i=g\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i,t}(\infty)-Y_{i,g-1}(\infty)\mid X_i,G_i=\infty\right] | (2)

where *X*~i~ contains country indicators, industry indicators, and log total assets and its square, all measured in year *g* − 1. Assumption (2) states that, among firms with the same covariates, the outcome of scored firms would have changed from year *g* − 1 to year *t* as the outcome of never-scored firms did. The assumption concerns changes, not levels, so the large differences in size between scored and unscored firms in Table 1 do not violate it by themselves. It is violated when scored firms were on a different path before coverage, as would happen if coverage followed a period of growth of the kind that precedes index additions (Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004). We test this implication with the pre-coverage estimates, and we do not rely on the test alone, because pre-trend tests can have low power and conditioning on them can distort inference (Roth, 2022).

## 4.2. Estimation

For each cohort *g* and each year *t*, we form the long difference ΔY~i,t~ = Y~i,t~ − Y~i,g−1~ and estimate an outcome regression among never-scored firms (Sant'Anna and Zhao, 2020):

$$latex \Delta Y_{i,t}=X_i'\beta_{g,t}+u_{i,t},\qquad G_i=\infty | (3)

This is the outcome-regression version of the group-time estimator of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021); the doubly robust version of Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020) adds a propensity-score model, which we do not use because scored and never-scored firms overlap poorly in size. The fitted values from Eq. (3) give the counterfactual change for each scored firm, and the estimated group-time effect is

$$latex \widehat{\mathrm{ATT}}(g,t)=\frac{1}{N_{g,t}}\sum_{i:\,G_i=g}\left(\Delta Y_{i,t}-X_i'\hat{\beta}_{g,t}\right) | (4)

where *N*~g,t~ is the number of firms first scored in year *g* with data in years *g* − 1 and *t*. Following the aggregation scheme of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021), we average the group-time effects by years since coverage, *e* = *t* − *g*, weighting each cohort by its number of scored firms:

$$latex \hat{\theta}(e)=\sum_{g}\frac{N_{g,g+e}}{\sum_{h}N_{h,h+e}}\,\widehat{\mathrm{ATT}}(g,g+e) | (5)

The headline estimate averages all group-time effects from the year of the first score to three years later, again weighting each cell by its number of scored firms, a variant of the simple aggregation in Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021):

$$latex \hat{\theta}_{\mathrm{post}}=\frac{\sum_{(g,t):\,0\le t-g\le 3}N_{g,t}\,\widehat{\mathrm{ATT}}(g,t)}{\sum_{(g,t):\,0\le t-g\le 3}N_{g,t}} | (6)

Cohorts first scored in 2022 or later are not observed for all four post-coverage years, so the composition of cohorts changes across event years, a problem that Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) and Baker, Larcker, and Wang (2022) discuss for event-study aggregations. We therefore also report estimates restricted to cohorts first scored no later than 2021, which are observed through event year three.

Three design choices deserve comment. First, the baseline control group contains only firms that are never scored, one of the two comparison groups proposed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021). Firms that are scored later are themselves likely to be growing toward the provider's universe, so using them as controls for earlier cohorts would compare two groups on similar upward paths; we report estimates that add them to the control group as a robustness check. Second, all comparisons use the year before coverage as the base year, including those for the years before coverage, so that pre-coverage and post-coverage estimates are measured against the same reference point, as the pre-trend analysis of Roth (2022) presumes. The pre-coverage estimates θ̂(*e*) for *e* ≤ −2 therefore measure the difference between the change of scored firms and the change of comparable never-scored firms from year *g* + *e* to year *g* − 1. A negative value means that scored firms grew faster over that interval. Third, the covariates are measured in the base year, at the end of any run-up. Because the provider's scores rise with firm size (Dobrick, Klein, and Zwergel, 2023), size is the covariate most closely related to selection into coverage. Conditioning on size at the end of a period of growth compares scored firms with never-scored firms that reached a similar size, which can absorb part of the run-up into the covariates. We therefore report estimates without covariates and estimates that condition explicitly on growth before the base year.

## 4.3. Inference

Inference uses a bootstrap, as recommended by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) for aggregated group-time effects. We resample firms with replacement, which keeps each firm's time series intact. We draw {{B_BOOT}} bootstrap samples with a fixed seed and use the same draws for every specification, so that differences between specifications have a valid joint distribution. We report the bootstrap standard error, the percentile 95% confidence interval, and a two-sided *p*-value from the normal approximation. The minimum detectable effect at 80% power and a 5% two-sided test is

$$latex \mathrm{MDE}=(z_{0.975}+z_{0.80})\,\widehat{\mathrm{SE}}\approx 2.8\,\widehat{\mathrm{SE}} | (7)

We test the primary outcome at the 5% level and adjust the three secondary outcomes with the Holm method. The *p*-values rely on the normal approximation to the bootstrap distribution, whereas the confidence intervals are percentile intervals; when the bootstrap distribution is asymmetric, a *p*-value near the 5% threshold and an interval whose end lies close to zero can therefore disagree slightly. We read the evidence from the intervals and the event-time profile rather than from any single threshold. The joint test of parallel pre-trends uses the event-time estimates for *e* = −5 to −2 and their bootstrap covariance matrix; following Roth (2022), we report it as a diagnostic and do not condition the analysis on its outcome:

$$latex W=\hat{\theta}_{\mathrm{pre}}'\,\hat{V}_{\mathrm{pre}}^{-1}\,\hat{\theta}_{\mathrm{pre}}\ \sim\ \chi^2_{4} | (8)

Coverage arrived in market-level waves, so shocks common to a market and year can affect many scored firms at once. The country indicators in Eq. (3) absorb market-wide changes between years *g* − 1 and *t* within each cell, and we report leave-one-market-out estimates. With five markets, a bootstrap that resamples markets would rest on too few clusters to be reliable, and we do not use one. Market-level differences in disclosure rules (Singapore Exchange, 2016; Krueger, Sautner, Tang, and Zhong, 2024) are one reason why common shocks within a market are plausible.

## 4.4. Sensitivity to departures from parallel trends

Because the pre-coverage estimates cast doubt on Eq. (2), and because a pre-trend test that fails to reject is weak evidence for parallel trends (Roth, 2022), we add two exploratory checks that the pre-analysis plan did not contain. The first removes a linear trend fitted to the pre-coverage event-time estimates, with the line constrained to pass through zero in the base year:

$$latex \hat{b}=\frac{\sum_{e=-5}^{-1}(e+1)\,\hat{\theta}(e)}{\sum_{e=-5}^{-1}(e+1)^{2}},\qquad \tilde{\theta}(e)=\hat{\theta}(e)-\hat{b}\,(e+1) | (9)

The trend-adjusted headline estimate averages θ̃(*e*) over *e* = 0 to 3 with the weights of Eq. (6). The second check bounds the bias from departures from parallel trends in the spirit of the relative-magnitudes restriction of Rambachan and Roth (2023). Let δ(*e*) denote the post-coverage violation of Eq. (2). We assume that it changes from one year to the next by no more than M̄ times the largest change between consecutive pre-coverage estimates:

$$latex \left|\delta(e)-\delta(e-1)\right|\le \bar{M}\,\max_{s\le -1}\left|\hat{\theta}(s)-\hat{\theta}(s-1)\right|\equiv \bar{M}\,\Delta,\qquad \delta(-1)=0 | (10)

Under Eq. (10), the bias of the event-year estimate is at most M̄Δ(*e* + 1), and we widen the bootstrap confidence interval of the headline estimate by the weighted average of this bound. This construction is conservative and simpler than the confidence sets of Rambachan and Roth (2023), which we do not compute. We also estimate each model after adding the growth of log market capitalization from year *g* − 3 to year *g* − 1 to *X*~i~, which compares scored firms with never-scored firms that grew at a similar rate before coverage.

## 4.5. Benchmark regression and robustness checks

To show how a conventional design reads the same data, we estimate the static two-way fixed effects regression that Goodman-Bacon (2021) and Baker, Larcker, and Wang (2022) analyze, on scored and never-scored firms:

$$latex Y_{i,t}=\alpha_i+\lambda_t+\beta\,D_{i,t}+\varepsilon_{i,t},\qquad D_{i,t}=\mathbf{1}\left[t\ge G_i\right] | (11)

with firm effects α~i~ and year effects λ~t~, no covariates, all event years, and standard errors clustered by firm. The coefficient β compares all post-coverage years with all pre-coverage years and averages over any run-up before coverage; with staggered timing it also uses already-scored firms as controls for later cohorts, which biases β when effects change over time (Goodman-Bacon, 2021; Baker, Larcker, and Wang, 2022).

The pre-analysis plan fixed five robustness checks: adding not-yet-scored firms to the controls, the alternative comparison group of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021), dropping the covariates, excluding the 2020 and 2021 cohorts, keeping only control firms whose log total assets in year *g* − 1 are at or above the 10th percentile of the scored firms in the cohort (a lower bound only), and a placebo that dates coverage three years before the first score and uses only years before the actual score. Besides the checks in Section 4.4, we added four exploratory analyses: dating coverage one year later, restricting the sample to cohorts observed through event year three, excluding one market at a time, and estimating the model separately for each market.

## 4.6. Use of generative AI

The authors used Claude (Anthropic), accessed through Claude Code in September 2026, to screen candidate research questions, draft the pre-analysis plan, write and debug the R code, draft and edit the text, and search for and check references. Five instances of the tool, each in a separate context, also produced simulated referee reports that informed the revision. The authors reviewed and approved the research question and the pre-analysis plan before any estimation, reviewed every output of the tool, checked each reported number against the R output files, and take full responsibility for the content.

# 5. Results

## 5.1. Which firms get scored

Table 1 compares scored firms in the year before their first score with never-scored firm-years. Scored firms are much larger: their median market capitalization is {{t1_mcap_tr_med}} million U.S. dollars against {{t1_mcap_nv_med}} million for never-scored firm-years, and their median total assets are {{t1_asset_ratio_med}} times those of never-scored firms. Their mean MTB ratio is {{t1_mtb_tr_mean}}, compared with {{t1_mtb_nv_mean}}, and their mean return on assets is {{t1_roa_tr_mean}}, compared with {{t1_roa_nv_mean}}. The normalized differences are largest for size ({{t1_mcap_nd}} for market capitalization and {{t1_asset_nd}} for total assets) and small for leverage ({{t1_lev_nd}}). These differences in levels fit the view that providers extend coverage to large and visible firms (Section 2.2), and the size gap matters for the scores themselves, because larger firms receive higher scores from this provider (Dobrick, Klein, and Zwergel, 2023). They motivate the comparison of changes and the adjustment for size, country, and industry in Eq. (3).

The medians tell a similar story. The median MTB ratio of scored firms in the year before coverage is {{t1_mtb_tr_med}}, against {{t1_mtb_nv_med}} for never-scored firm-years, and the median leverage of the two groups is almost the same ({{t1_lev_tr_med}} and {{t1_lev_nv_med}}). Scored firms are therefore not more levered than unscored firms, but they are larger and valued more highly by the market in the year before coverage. Return on assets is available for far fewer firm-years than the other variables (Table 1), so we use it only descriptively and do not include it among the covariates or outcomes. The difference in MTB levels is consistent with the pre-coverage growth documented in Section 5.3: firms that enter coverage have recently gained market value relative to their book value, as firms do before they are added to an index (Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004).

## 5.2. Average effects of the first score

Table 2 reports the headline estimates of Eq. (6). The effect on log MTB is {{mtb_att}}, with a standard error of {{mtb_se}} and a 95% confidence interval from {{mtb_lo}} to {{mtb_hi}}. In terms of the MTB ratio, the interval excludes changes outside the range from {{mtb_lo_pct}} to {{mtb_hi_pct}} percent under assumption (2). The minimum detectable effect from Eq. (7) is {{mtb_mde}}, so an effect of about {{mtb_mde_pct}} percent on the MTB ratio would be detected with 80% probability, and effects of a few percent cannot be ruled out. The effect on log market capitalization is {{mcap_att}} (Holm-adjusted *p* {{mcap_pholm_txt}}). Total assets rise by {{asset_att}} log points after coverage (unadjusted *p* {{asset_p_txt}}; Holm-adjusted *p* {{asset_pholm_txt}}), and leverage rises by {{lev_att_pp}} percentage points (Holm-adjusted *p* {{lev_pholm_txt}}). None of the four outcomes shows a significant change at the 5% level after the Holm adjustment. The MTB estimate is thus far from the positive effect that the recognition channel of Merton (1987) and the preference channel of Pástor, Stambaugh, and Taylor (2021) and Pedersen, Fitzgibbons, and Pomorski (2021) predict, and it contrasts with the strong response of fund flows to newly published sustainability ratings documented by Hartzmark and Sussman (2019). The absence of a significant change in leverage and assets also differs from the U.S. evidence that coverage is followed by changes in firm conduct and financial policy (Tsang et al., 2024; Tsang et al., 2025; Bikmetova and Pirinsky, 2026), although our outcomes are not the ones those studies examine.

## 5.3. Dynamics before and after the first score

Figure 1 plots the event-time estimates of Eq. (5) for all four outcomes. Before the first score, the coefficients for market capitalization and MTB are negative and rise toward zero. For market capitalization, the estimates are {{mcap_em5}} five years and {{mcap_em4}} four years before the base year; for MTB, they are {{mtb_em5}} and {{mtb_em4}}. A negative pre-coverage coefficient means that the scored firms' outcome was lower, relative to its base-year level, than the path of comparable never-scored firms implies; equivalently, scored firms grew faster than comparable firms in the years before the base year. This run-up resembles the growth that precedes additions to a major index (Shleifer, 1986; Harris and Gurel, 1986; Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004) and is the pattern the selection view in Section 2.2 predicts. Over the four years from event year −5 to the base year, scored firms' market capitalization grew {{mcap_runup_m5}} percent more than that of comparable firms, and their MTB ratio {{mtb_runup_m5}} percent more. The joint test of Eq. (8) rejects parallel pre-trends for market capitalization (*p* {{mcap_pre_p_txt}}) but not at the 5% level for MTB (*p* {{mtb_pre_p_txt}}), although the individual MTB estimates for event years −5 and −4 are significant (*p* {{mtb_em5_p_txt}} and *p* {{mtb_em4_p_txt}}). Total assets follow a similar but weaker pattern, and leverage falls toward the base year (pre-trend *p* {{lev_pre_p_txt}}). As Roth (2022) cautions, a joint test that does not reject at the 5% level, as for MTB, is not evidence that pre-trends are absent.

After the first score, the MTB coefficients lie between {{mtb_e3}} and {{mtb_e2}} from event year 0 to event year 3, and none differs from zero at the 5% level. In event year 4, which only the earliest cohorts reach, the MTB estimate is {{mtb_e4}} (*p* {{mtb_e4_p_txt}}). For market capitalization, the estimate for event year 1 is {{mcap_e1}} (*p* {{mcap_e1_p_txt}}), and the estimates for later years are not significant. Total assets rise after coverage, with an estimate of {{asset_e3}} in event year 3, and leverage returns toward its earlier level. The valuation gap between scored and comparable firms thus widens before coverage and stops widening afterwards. There is no sign of the price decline that follows a loss of analyst coverage (Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2012) or of a mirror-image increase after coverage begins. The paths of the balance-sheet outcomes are consistent with firms that raise equity or grow their assets before they enter coverage: leverage declines toward the base year, and total assets rise both before and after. Without data on share issuance, we cannot tell whether the growth in market capitalization before coverage reflects rising prices, new shares, or both, which is why we base statements about valuation on the MTB ratio.

## 5.4. Timing of coverage and sensitivity to pre-trends

Table 3 reports the robustness checks, including those that address the timing of coverage and the pre-trends. When we date coverage one year after the first scored fiscal year (row R10), so that the base year is the first scored year and the post-coverage window starts when a score could first have been published, the MTB effect is {{mtb_R10}} (95% interval {{mtb_R10_lo}} to {{mtb_R10_hi}}; *p* {{mtb_R10_p_txt}}), a decline of about {{mtb_R10_pct}} percent. The market capitalization effect is {{mcap_R10}} (*p* {{mcap_R10_p_txt}}), and the asset effect is {{asset_R10}}. Valuations therefore reach their relative peak in the first scored year and decline in the following years. This pattern is what one would expect if the provider selects firms after a period of unusually high valuation and part of that valuation later reverses, and it is also what one would expect if coverage lowered valuations. The two readings cannot be separated with these data, but neither implies a valuation gain. The decline also fits the timing problems in the data: because historical scores were rewritten (Berg, Fabisik, and Sautner, 2020) and recent scores remain subject to revision (Sahin et al., 2023), the first scored fiscal year can lie before publication, and dating coverage later moves the base year closer to the end of the run-up.

Restricting the sample to cohorts first scored no later than 2021, which are observed through event year 3 (row R11), gives an MTB effect of {{mtb_R11}} (*p* {{mtb_R11_p_txt}}), so the changing composition of cohorts across event years does not drive the headline estimate. Removing a linear pre-trend with Eq. (9) (row R7) changes the MTB effect to {{mtb_R7}} (95% interval {{mtb_R7_lo}} to {{mtb_R7_hi}}). The estimate is negative because a continued linear run-up would have raised valuations further, but the interval includes zero. For market capitalization the same adjustment gives {{mcap_R7}} (*p* {{mcap_R7_p_txt}}): relative to a continued linear run-up, scored firms' market value grew more slowly after coverage. Conditioning on pre-coverage growth (row R8), which compares scored firms with never-scored firms that grew at a similar rate before coverage and that therefore share any tendency to revert, gives an MTB effect of {{mtb_R8}} (*p* {{mtb_R8_p_txt}}). If part of the pre-coverage growth reflected temporary demand of the kind documented around index additions, whose price effects partly reverse (Harris and Gurel, 1986), this comparison nets out the reversal and still shows no significant gain.

Table IA5 of the Internet Appendix reports the bounds of Eq. (10), which follow the logic of the relative-magnitudes restriction of Rambachan and Roth (2023). The largest change between consecutive pre-coverage MTB estimates is {{mtb_rm_dmax}}. With M̄ = 0.25, the robust interval for the MTB effect is {{mtb_rm025_lo}} to {{mtb_rm025_hi}}; with M̄ = 0.5, it is {{mtb_rm050_lo}} to {{mtb_rm050_hi}}; and with M̄ = 1, it is {{mtb_rm100_lo}} to {{mtb_rm100_hi}}. Every interval includes zero, and none excludes effects of moderate size in either direction once departures from parallel trends of the size seen before coverage are allowed. The post-coverage null is therefore conditional on assumption (2), whereas the absence of a positive effect in every specification, including row R10, does not depend on that assumption holding exactly.

## 5.5. Robustness and heterogeneity

The pre-specified checks in rows R1 to R4 of Table 3 leave the valuation result unchanged, including the change of comparison group proposed by Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) and the removal of the outcome-regression covariates of Sant'Anna and Zhao (2020). The effect on log MTB is {{mtb_R1}} when not-yet-scored firms join the control group, {{mtb_R2}} without covariates, {{mtb_R3}} without the 2020 and 2021 cohorts, and {{mtb_R4}} when control firms below the size range of scored firms are dropped; none differs from zero at the 10% level. The size results are less stable. The market capitalization effect shrinks to {{mcap_R4}} under the size restriction, and the asset effect falls to {{asset_R2}} without covariates and to {{asset_R3}} without the 2020 and 2021 cohorts but rises to {{asset_R4}} under the size restriction. We therefore do not read the asset estimate in Table 2 as evidence that coverage causes firms to grow.

The placebo in row R5 dates coverage three years before the first score and uses only years before the actual score. It yields an effect of {{mtb_R5}} on log MTB (*p* {{mtb_R5_p_txt}}) and of {{mcap_R5}} on log market capitalization (*p* {{mcap_R5_p_txt}}). The placebo fails, and the failure restates the pre-coverage growth shown in Figure 1 in a different form rather than adding independent evidence. Row R6 reports the static two-way fixed effects regression of Eq. (11). It attributes an increase of {{mtb_R6}} in log MTB (*p* {{mtb_R6_p_txt}}) and of {{mcap_R6}} in log market capitalization to coverage. Because it compares all post-coverage years with all earlier years, it counts part of the pre-coverage growth as an effect of the rating. The gap between rows R6 and the baseline is an example of the biases of static two-way fixed effects regressions under staggered timing described by Goodman-Bacon (2021) and Baker, Larcker, and Wang (2022).

Row R9 and Table IA1 of the Internet Appendix exclude one market at a time. Across the five leave-one-market-out samples, the MTB effect ranges from {{mtb_lomo_min}} to {{mtb_lomo_max}}, and excluding Malaysia gives {{mtb_R9}} (*p* {{mtb_R9_p_txt}}). The market capitalization effect is less stable: it turns to {{mcap_R9}} when Malaysian firms are excluded, so the negative baseline estimate for market capitalization reflects the large Malaysian cohorts of 2021 and 2022. Estimated market by market (Table IA3), the MTB effect is {{mtb_pm_MY}} in Malaysia ({{mtb_pm_MY_ntr}} scored firms) and {{mtb_pm_TH}} in Thailand ({{mtb_pm_TH_ntr}} scored firms); the estimates for Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore rest on few scored firms and have wide confidence intervals. The Singaporean estimate is of interest because Singapore required sustainability reports from financial year 2017 (Singapore Exchange, 2016), and mandatory disclosure changes the information environment on its own (Krueger, Sautner, Tang, and Zhong, 2024); it is small and imprecise.

The last three rows of Table 3 split scored firms at the median of the first ESG score within their cohort. The MTB effect is {{mtb_high}} for firms that enter coverage with a high score and {{mtb_low}} for firms with a low score. The difference of {{mtb_diff}} (standard error {{mtb_diff_se}}, *p* {{mtb_diff_p_txt}}) is not significant, and its minimum detectable value is {{mtb_diff_mde}}. We find no evidence that the content of the first score matters for valuation, but the test cannot exclude moderate differences. Pedersen, Fitzgibbons, and Pomorski (2021) predict that a high score raises prices through investor preferences, and the analyst literature finds that favorable first coverage raises prices (Demiroglu and Ryngaert, 2010); a weak signal is one explanation for the absence of such a difference, given that scores from different providers disagree (Berg, Kölbel, and Rigobon, 2022; Christensen, Serafeim, and Sikochi, 2022). Because recent scores can be revised after publication (Sahin et al., 2023), the initial scores used for this split may differ from those that investors saw.

## 5.6. Economic magnitude

The confidence interval of the headline estimate is informative about persistent revaluation but not about short-lived price effects. Under assumption (2), the upper end of the interval corresponds to an increase of {{mtb_hi_pct}} percent in the MTB ratio. This is of the same order as the announcement return of 4.86 percent that Demiroglu and Ryngaert (2010) report for the first analyst coverage of neglected stocks, and larger than the price increase of more than 3 percent that Harris and Gurel (1986) report for additions to the S&P 500, most of which reversed within about two weeks. Annual valuation ratios measured at fiscal year-end would not detect an announcement effect of that size that reverses within weeks. Our estimates therefore speak to whether a first score leaves a lasting mark on valuation, and they say little about trading around the day on which a score is published. A lasting effect would be expected from a permanent increase in investor recognition (Merton, 1987; Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004), while price pressure from index demand is temporary (Harris and Gurel, 1986).

The dynamics offer a second benchmark. Over the four years before the base year, scored firms' MTB ratio grew {{mtb_runup_m5}} percent more than that of comparable firms, and their market capitalization {{mcap_runup_m5}} percent more. A lasting valuation effect as large as half of this run-up would lie at the upper end of the headline interval, and an effect as large as the run-up itself lies outside the interval under assumption (2). Relative to the growth that precedes coverage, any valuation effect of the first score is small, which is consistent with a provider that covers firms after they have become visible to investors (Merton, 1987; Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004).

# 6. Discussion

## 6.1. Interpreting the post-coverage path

The event study admits three readings of the flat MTB path after the first score, which correspond to different assumptions about how the pre-coverage trend would have evolved (Roth, 2022; Rambachan and Roth, 2023). If scored and never-scored firms would have followed parallel paths from the base year onward, coverage had no effect on valuation within the interval reported in Section 5.2. If the pre-coverage run-up would have continued without coverage, the flat path implies that coverage lowered valuations relative to that trend, which is the reading of the trend-adjusted estimate. If instead the run-up was partly transitory and would have reversed, the flat path is consistent with a positive effect of coverage that offset the reversal. The last reading deserves weight, because firms that enter coverage after a period of relative growth are likely to be selected on transitory as well as permanent components of value, as the partial reversal of index-addition effects illustrates (Harris and Gurel, 1986; Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004).

Three pieces of evidence speak to the reversal reading. First, when coverage is dated one year later, MTB ratios decline after the first scored year, which is what a reversal would produce and gives no sign of an offsetting gain. Second, when scored firms are compared with never-scored firms that grew at a similar rate before coverage, and that are therefore subject to similar reversal, the MTB effect is small and insignificant. Third, the bounds in Section 5.4, built on the relative-magnitudes idea of Rambachan and Roth (2023), include zero for every value of M̄ we consider, but they also include effects of several percent in both directions. The evidence therefore does not show that coverage has no effect. It shows that no specification detects a valuation gain after the first score, and that the most robust feature of the data is the ordering of events: the first score follows a period of relative growth and coincides with a valuation peak.

The market-level estimates reinforce this reading. The two markets with enough scored firms for precise estimates, Malaysia and Thailand, both show MTB effects close to zero, and no market shows a significant positive effect. The coverage waves differ in timing across markets: the Thai and Singaporean waves came in 2019 and 2020, the Malaysian wave in 2021 and 2022. A common market-wide shock is therefore unlikely to explain the pattern, although the waves may reflect market-specific changes in disclosure rules (Singapore Exchange, 2016; Krueger, Sautner, Tang, and Zhong, 2024) or index composition that we do not observe.

## 6.2. Relation to prior evidence

The absence of a detectable valuation gain differs from the evidence on sell-side coverage, where the loss of coverage lowers prices (Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2012) and the first report on a neglected stock raises prices when it is favorable (Demiroglu and Ryngaert, 2010). Two features of ESG scores may explain the difference. An ESG score rarely contains news about cash flows, and it arrives with a lag after the firm's own disclosures. In addition, the firms in our sample were already large and visible before their first LSEG score (Table 1), and some of them had been scored by FTSE Russell, so the recognition channel of Merton (1987) had less room to operate; we have not tested this explanation directly because the data contain no measures of ownership or investor attention.

The results also fit the evidence on rating disagreement and investor demand. If ESG funds follow one provider more than others (Berg, Heeb, and Kölbel, 2022), coverage by a different provider may matter little for demand, and the dispersion of scores across providers (Berg, Kölbel, and Rigobon, 2022; Christensen, Serafeim, and Sikochi, 2022) weakens the information content of any single score. The pre-coverage growth resembles the conditions under which firms join an index. Price effects of index additions concentrate around the announcement and partly reverse (Shleifer, 1986; Harris and Gurel, 1986; Chen, Noronha, and Singal, 2004), and annual data cannot isolate an effect of that kind. Our evidence complements the U.S. findings that coverage changes firm conduct (Tsang et al., 2024; Bikmetova and Pirinsky, 2026) and financial policy (Tsang et al., 2025): we find no stable change in leverage or assets, and we observe no measures of conduct.

## 6.3. Implications

The main implication is methodological. A cross-sectional valuation premium of rated firms, or a static two-way fixed effects estimate, can reflect the selection of firms into coverage rather than an effect of ratings. In our data, the static regression suggests that coverage raises the MTB ratio by {{mtb_R6_pct}} percent, while the heterogeneity-robust estimator and its event-time profile attribute the gap to growth before coverage (Callaway and Sant'Anna, 2021; Roth, 2022). Studies that compare rated and unrated firms in these markets should model the timing of coverage and report pre-coverage dynamics.

For listed firms in the five markets, the estimates give no support to the expectation that a first LSEG score will raise the market valuation of their shares through investor recognition or preferences (Merton, 1987; Pástor, Stambaugh, and Taylor, 2021), although they cannot rule out effects smaller than about {{mtb_mde_pct}} percent. For investors and exchanges, the results imply that the set of scored firms is a selected group whose valuation history differs from that of unscored firms, which matters for index construction and for any comparison of the two groups. Whether the same ordering holds in other emerging markets, or for other rating providers, is a hypothesis that these data cannot test.

# 7. Limitations

The study has seven limitations. First, the provider chooses when to cover a firm, and we have no source of variation in coverage that is unrelated to firm performance. The post-coverage estimates rely on conditional parallel trends from the base year, an assumption that the pre-coverage estimates call into question. Our sensitivity analysis uses a linear trend and a simplified bound; we do not compute the confidence sets of Rambachan and Roth (2023). Second, the data are annual and may contain backfilled or revised scores, so we observe neither the date on which a first score was published nor announcement returns; dating coverage one year later addresses only part of this gap. Third, we observe coverage by LSEG only. Some firms had scores from other providers before their first LSEG score, including FTSE Russell scores for Malaysian index constituents (Bernama, 2022), and the event we study is then an additional score rather than a first rating of any kind. Fourth, the data contain no stock returns, shares outstanding, ownership, index membership, or dates of sustainability reports, so we cannot separate price changes from share issuance, test the recognition channel directly, or show whether first scores coincide with index entry or with a firm's first sustainability report. Fifth, a small number of market capitalization values in the source data are implausibly large, winsorization over the pooled sample limits their influence without correcting them, and return on assets is available for a minority of firm-years. Sixth, Malaysian and Thai firms account for {{pct_my_th_treated}} percent of scored firms, so the pooled estimates weight those markets heavily. Seventh, the minimum detectable effect on log MTB is {{mtb_mde}}, so the design cannot rule out valuation effects smaller than about {{mtb_mde_pct}} percent even under parallel trends.

# 8. Conclusion

Using the staggered first appearance of LSEG ESG scores for {{n_treated_all}} non-financial firms in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, we find that scored firms grew faster than comparable never-scored firms before their first scored year and that their market-to-book ratios did not rise afterwards. The headline effect is {{mtb_att}} under parallel trends, and dating coverage one year later gives {{mtb_R10}}. The first LSEG score therefore arrives near a valuation peak rather than before a gain. Analyses that compare rated and unrated firms without modeling the timing of coverage will attribute this selection to the rating.

note:=Circles show the estimates of Eq. (5) relative to the year before the first score (event year −1, set to zero) and bars show bootstrap 95% confidence intervals; open circles with dotted bars are years before the first score and filled circles with solid bars are the year of the first score and later years. Log outcomes are in log points and book leverage is a ratio.

@@ ia_intro
This Internet Appendix accompanies "Rated at the Peak? Firm Valuation around the First LSEG ESG Score in Five Southeast Asian Markets." Table IA1 re-estimates the average effects of the first score over event years 0 to 3 after excluding one market at a time. Table IA2 and Figure IA1 show the number of non-financial firms that received their first LSEG ESG score in each year, by market. Table IA3 reports the estimates for each market separately, Table IA4 the number of firm-years available for each outcome, and Table IA5 the relative-magnitude bounds of Eq. (10) in the paper. The pre-analysis plan is provided with the replication package.
